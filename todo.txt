This is the todo file for metadata.py

== To Do ==
 + write basic script, copying from tuxmake/metadata.pl
   + convert ini file into json file with metadata
 - copy ini files from tuxmake
 - replace "{compiler}" and "{builddir}" with appropriate values
   for a kernel build
   - use CROSS_COMPILE and BUILD_DIR environment vars?
 - see the final schema for tuxmake
   - figure out what the section names should be for each metadata item

== Notes ==
It turns out the there is a metadata.pl and a metadata.py in tuxmake

metadata.pl does metadata collection
 - converting cmds in a json file into strings
metadata.py does more stuff
 - convert metadata.ini files into metadata.json
 - processing things like order, type, section names
   - creating temporary metadata.json files

Some of the commands (artifacts.ini) actually construct data files, that
are then referenced by the metadata json output file.
