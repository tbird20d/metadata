To gather information about the tools and build environment
of a system, cat one or more .ini files into metadata.py
The tools will run the commands, and save a json file
with sections and keys for different tool version strings.

example:
  $ cat os.ini compiler.ini hardware.ini uname.ini \
     | ./metadata.py | tee build_env.json
